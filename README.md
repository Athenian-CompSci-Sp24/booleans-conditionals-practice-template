# Booleans & Conditionals Practice

Use this repository (repo, for short) to complete your practice for this lesson.

Here are a couple resources if you want something to read:
* [Handout](Booleans_conditionals.pdf)
* [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist chapter](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/conditionals.html)

## Complete the following:
#### Edpuzzle
* [Edpuzzle practice](src/edpuzzle_practice.py)
  * Use this for practice during the Edpuzzle video. You can use the main window or the Python Console (see button at the bottom of the PyCharm window)

#### Parsons Puzzles  
* [Parsons Puzzle: if-elif-else](https://athenian-computer-science.github.io/hosting-parsons-on-github-template/parsons/if-elif-else.html)

#### ReadingBat
Choose some of these exercises to practice:
* [booleans3](https://www.readingbat.com/content/python/Athenian:%20Booleans/boolean3)
* [greater_than2](https://www.readingbat.com/content/python/Athenian:%20Booleans/greater_than2)
* [is_equal2](https://www.readingbat.com/content/python/Athenian:%20Booleans/is_equal2)
* [not_equal2](https://www.readingbat.com/content/python/Athenian:%20Booleans/not_equal2)
* [divisibility](https://www.readingbat.com/content/python/Athenian:%20Booleans/divisibility)
* [conditionals8](https://www.readingbat.com/content/python/Athenian:%20Conditionals/conditionals8)


#### Fix & Write Code  
* [Fix the Code #1](src/fix_code_1.py)
  * Fix the code so it collects a password from the user and returns a response based on the input. The password for this exercise is `p@sSwoRd!` - not a good password but it will work for this.
  * If the password is typed correctly, the program should return `Password accepted!`. Otherwise, it should return `Invalid password - goodbye.`
    * GitHub will test your solution when you submit. See instructions at the end of this page.
* [Write Code #1: Calculate Payment](src/write_code_1.py) üöÅ
  * Your goal is to make a payment calculator for your employees. No overtime is given (that's another program).
  * The hourly rate is 15.25 dollars per hour. 
  * You will need to prompt the user for their hours for the week. Only whole numbers need to be considered for hours.
  * Your function should be called `calc_pay`, accept the hours worked, and return the salary for the week.
  * Example:
  ```
  Weekly hours? 10
  returned salary: 152.50

  Weekly hours? 40
  returned salary: 610
  ```
    * GitHub will run a test on this when you submit it.

* Fix Code #2
  * The function in this program accept a number from the user and check to see if it is even or odd. (Use the modulo operator!)
  * If the number is even, return `even`. If it is odd, return `odd`.
  * Do not change the function's name!

### Submitting your Repo
* When you have completed each task, commit and push to GitHub.
* Go to the repo on GitHub and click on the Pull Requests tab. Look for feedback about code function and style. If any issues are found, fix them and check your changes in to GitHub. repeat until no errors are found.
* When done, submit "Done" on Canvas.
